    <p>The Vietnamese Student Association was founded many years ago with the intention of uniting Vietnamese students and raising awareness of Vietnamese culture around campus. After a period of inactivity, the newly reformed organization is now thriving with a mission to help both international and domestic students of Vietnamese descent. By providing guidance, cultural understanding, and fun activities for students, we hope to help them adapt to college life while maintaining a connection with their heritage.VSA is continuously working to promote the unique culture Vietnam has to offer to RIT's campus as well as the greater Rochester community.</p>
